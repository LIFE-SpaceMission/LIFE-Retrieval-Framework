# pyRetLIFE documentation
## Introduction
`pyRetLIFE` is a retrieval suite based on pymultinest and petitRADTRANS that has been used in previous papers of the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanets) series. It provides tools for atmospheric retrieval and analysis of exoplanet spectra.

## How to cite
When using `pyRetLIFE` please cite [LIFE III](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...664A..23K/abstract) and [LIFE V](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...665A.106A/abstract):
